Does Fandango Still Inflate Movie Ratings?


In October 2015, a data journalist by the name of Walt Hickey disvcovered that movie ratings from Fandango were rather biased and dishonest: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/

By the end of this project, we aim to see if Fandango's updated ratings system still showcases the fallacies as before, or if they have updated their system after Hickey's discoveries.
